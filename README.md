# Semaphore Translator App (STRAP) 

**Semaphore Translator App** was created to assist scouting activities, especially on semaphore translating. Our teams consist of 3 Machine Learning (ML), 2 Cloud Computing (CC), and 2 Mobile Development (MD) team.


## Our Team | | CH2-PS420 ü§ù

Our team consists of three paths with different tasks, namely Mobile Development path who is responsible for building the android application, Machine Learning path who is responsible for building a machine learning model to classify semaphore images, and Cloud Computing path who is responsible for integrating and facilitating the connection between the other two learning paths through APIs.

## Features üí°

### Image Classification

This feature is useful for displaying information related to the symptoms, causes, prevention, and treatment of rice diseases. This feature is equipped with a camera or direct access to local files to upload images of rice diseases.  This feature will classify four rice diseases namely brown spot, blast, bacterial leaf blight, and tungro and combined with healthy rice.

### Plant Monitoring Schedule

In this feature, combined with the weather API, users will get daily crop management recommendations using the scheduled cycle method and can make informed decisions about their planting schedule. Users can also input planting dates and get day-to-day care recommendations until harvest time.

### Weather API

This feature is used to view the weather when users will be farming. This is useful so that users can make informed decisions regarding their planting schedules.

## Next Feature Releases üîú

### Leaderboard Game

Our next planned feature was:

- users enable to upload their result score and competing with others
- users can predict semaphore in realtime, making it working without internet connection

# Semaphore Translator App (STRAP) 

**Semaphore Translator App** was created to assist scouting activities, especially on semaphore translating. Our teams consist of 3 Machine Learning (ML), 2 Cloud Computing (CC), and 2 Mobile Development (MD) team.


## Our Team | | CH2-PS420 ü§ù

Our team consists of three paths with different tasks, namely Mobile Development path who is responsible for building the android application, Machine Learning path who is responsible for building a machine learning model to classify semaphore images, and Cloud Computing path who is responsible for integrating and facilitating the connection between the other two learning paths through APIs.
